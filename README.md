## 🇬🇧 Project Description

**Simple Runner** is a sample **infinite runner game** developed during the **summer internship at KIUT**.  
The main goal was to learn how to design and structure games using the **Unity engine** and understand the basics of **game architecture**.

This project became my **most challenging and rewarding experience**, involving gameplay creation, UI design, ECS logic, and state management.
